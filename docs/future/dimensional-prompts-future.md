# Future: Advanced Dimensional Prompt System

## Vision

A fully compositional prompt system where each dimension meaningfully transforms the conversation's character. Users could craft precise experimental conditions by combining orthogonal dimensions.

## Complete Dimension Set

### 1. CONTEXT (Relationship Dynamic)
```python
CONTEXT = {
    "peers": "Hello! I'm excited to explore {topic} together.",
    "teaching": "I'd like to help you understand {topic}. Let me explain",
    "debate": "I strongly disagree about {topic}. Here's why:",
    "interview": "I'm curious about your thoughts on {topic}. Can you tell me?",
    "collaboration": "Let's work together to figure out {topic}.",
    "socratic": "Let me ask you some questions about {topic} to explore deeper.",
    "adversarial": "I'll challenge every claim you make about {topic}. Defend your position.",
}
```

### 2. TOPIC (Subject Matter)
```python
TOPIC = {
    # Abstract concepts
    "philosophy": "the fundamental nature of reality",
    "consciousness": "the nature of awareness and experience",
    "language": "how we communicate and create meaning",
    "ethics": "what constitutes right action",
    
    # Concrete domains
    "science": "how the universe works",
    "technology": "the tools we create and their implications",
    "mathematics": "the patterns underlying reality",
    
    # Creative domains
    "art": "human expression and aesthetic experience",
    "music": "sonic patterns and emotional resonance",
    "storytelling": "narrative construction and meaning",
    
    # Meta domains
    "meta": "our own conversation and thinking",
    "compression": "efficient communication patterns",
    "emergence": "how complex patterns arise from simple rules",
    
    # Special cases
    "puzzles": "[CONTENT]",  # User provides puzzle
    "paradoxes": "[CONTENT]", # User provides paradox
    "scenarios": "[CONTENT]", # User provides scenario
}
```

### 3. MODE (Cognitive Approach)
```python
MODE = {
    "analytical": "Let's systematically analyze each component.",
    "intuitive": "I sense there are deeper patterns here worth exploring.",
    "exploratory": "I wonder what emerges if we follow our curiosity.",
    "focused": "Let's concentrate specifically on the core elements.",
    "dialectical": "Let's explore through thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.",
    "experimental": "Let's test our ideas through thought experiments.",
    "poetic": "Let's explore through metaphor and imagery.",
}
```

### 4. ENERGY (Conversational Intensity)
```python
ENERGY = {
    "calm": {
        "greeting_mod": "gently",
        "verb_forms": {"explore": "gently explore", "discuss": "quietly discuss"},
        "punctuation": ".",
        "intensity": 0.3
    },
    "balanced": {
        "greeting_mod": "",
        "verb_forms": {"explore": "explore", "discuss": "discuss"},
        "punctuation": ".",
        "intensity": 0.5
    },
    "engaged": {
        "greeting_mod": "actively",
        "verb_forms": {"explore": "actively explore", "discuss": "eagerly discuss"},
        "punctuation": "!",
        "intensity": 0.7
    },
    "passionate": {
        "greeting_mod": "intensely",
        "verb_forms": {"explore": "passionately explore", "discuss": "fervently discuss"},
        "punctuation": "!",
        "intensity": 0.9
    }
}
```

### 5. FORMALITY (Linguistic Register)
```python
FORMALITY = {
    "casual": {
        "greeting": "Hey",
        "contract": True,
        "vocabulary": "simple",
        "structure": "loose",
        "examples": ["I'm", "Let's", "gonna", "kinda"]
    },
    "conversational": {
        "greeting": "Hi",
        "contract": True,
        "vocabulary": "standard",
        "structure": "balanced",
        "examples": ["I'm", "Let's", "will", "somewhat"]
    },
    "professional": {
        "greeting": "Hello",
        "contract": False,
        "vocabulary": "precise",
        "structure": "clear",
        "examples": ["I am", "Let us", "will", "relatively"]
    },
    "academic": {
        "greeting": "Greetings",
        "contract": False,
        "vocabulary": "sophisticated",
        "structure": "formal",
        "examples": ["I am", "Let us", "shall", "considerably"]
    }
}
```

### 6. PERSPECTIVE (Viewpoint)
```python
PERSPECTIVE = {
    "first_person": "From my perspective on {topic}...",
    "second_person": "Consider your understanding of {topic}...",
    "third_person": "One might observe about {topic}...",
    "collective": "We might discover about {topic}...",
    "omniscient": "From all angles, {topic} reveals...",
}
```

### 7. TEMPORALITY (Time Orientation)
```python
TEMPORALITY = {
    "present": "exploring what is",
    "past": "examining what was",
    "future": "imagining what could be",
    "timeless": "considering eternal aspects",
    "cyclical": "recognizing recurring patterns",
}
```

### 8. EPISTEMOLOGY (Knowledge Approach)
```python
EPISTEMOLOGY = {
    "empirical": "based on observable evidence",
    "rational": "through logical deduction",
    "pragmatic": "focusing on practical outcomes",
    "phenomenological": "examining direct experience",
    "constructivist": "recognizing knowledge as constructed",
}
```

## Advanced Composition Engine

### Template System
```python
class DimensionalPromptEngine:
    def compose(self, dimensions: Dict[str, str]) -> str:
        # Start with base template
        template = self.get_base_template(dimensions)
        
        # Apply each dimension as a transformation
        for dim_name, dim_value in dimensions.items():
            template = self.apply_dimension(template, dim_name, dim_value)
        
        # Post-process for coherence
        return self.ensure_coherence(template)
```

### Dimension Interactions
Some dimensions interact in meaningful ways:
- `debate` + `calm` = "respectful disagreement"
- `teaching` + `socratic` = "guided discovery"
- `analytical` + `poetic` = "systematic metaphor exploration"

### Validation Rules
- Certain combinations are discouraged (e.g., `adversarial` + `collaborative`)
- Some require others (e.g., `puzzles` requires a puzzle content)
- Context influences available modes

## Example Compositions

### Simple (2 dimensions)
```bash
pidgin chat -d peers:philosophy
# "Hello! I'm excited to explore the fundamental nature of reality together."
```

### Complex (5 dimensions)
```bash
pidgin chat -d teaching:consciousness:socratic:calm:academic
# "Greetings. I shall gently guide you through questions about the nature of awareness and experience, encouraging your own discovery through careful inquiry."
```

### Experimental (7 dimensions)
```bash
pidgin chat -d debate:ethics:dialectical:passionate:academic:collective:future
# "Greetings. We must fervently examine what could constitute right action through rigorous thesis and antithesis! Let us collaboratively forge new understanding for tomorrow's moral landscape!"
```

## Research Applications

### Dimension Sweep Experiments
```python
# Test all energy levels with same base
for energy in ["calm", "balanced", "engaged", "passionate"]:
    run_conversation(f"peers:philosophy:analytical:{energy}")
```

### Interaction Studies
```python
# Test how formality affects debate dynamics
for formality in ["casual", "academic"]:
    for context in ["debate", "collaboration"]:
        run_conversation(f"{context}:ethics:analytical:balanced:{formality}")
```

### Emergence Patterns
- Do certain dimension combinations lead to faster convergence?
- Which dimensions most strongly influence compression?
- Are there "attractor dimensions" that dominate outcomes?

## Implementation Considerations

### Storage Format
```yaml
dimensional_prompts:
  - id: "exp_001"
    dimensions:
      context: "peers"
      topic: "consciousness"
      mode: "exploratory"
      energy: "engaged"
    metrics:
      convergence_rate: 0.73
      compression_turn: 23
      symbol_emergence: true
```

### API Design
```python
# Programmatic generation
prompt = DimensionalPrompt()
    .context("debate")
    .topic("language")
    .mode("analytical")
    .energy("passionate")
    .formality("academic")
    .build()

# Dimension arithmetic
base = DimensionalPrompt("peers:philosophy")
variant = base.with_energy("passionate").with_mode("poetic")
```

### Validation & Constraints
```python
CONSTRAINTS = {
    "incompatible": [
        ("adversarial", "collaboration"),
        ("calm", "passionate"),
    ],
    "required_pairs": [
        ("puzzles", "puzzle_content"),
        ("socratic", ["teaching", "interview"]),
    ],
    "dimension_limits": {
        "max_dimensions": 8,
        "min_dimensions": 2,
    }
}
```

## Future Research Questions

1. **Dimensional Dominance**: Which dimensions most strongly affect conversation outcomes?
2. **Interaction Effects**: Do certain combinations create emergent behaviors?
3. **Compression Catalysts**: Which dimensions accelerate linguistic compression?
4. **Attractor Dimensions**: Do certain settings reliably produce specific attractor states?
5. **Cross-Model Stability**: How do dimensions affect different model pairs?
6. **Optimal Complexity**: Is there a sweet spot for number of dimensions?

## Notes

This advanced system would enable:
- Precise experimental control
- Systematic exploration of conversation space
- Reproducible initial conditions
- Rich analytical possibilities

But it requires:
- Sophisticated composition engine
- Extensive testing of interactions
- Clear documentation of effects
- Validation of orthogonality
