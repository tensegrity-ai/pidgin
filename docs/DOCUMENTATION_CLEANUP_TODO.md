# Documentation Cleanup TODO

## Completed
- ✅ Rewrote README.md to be skeptical and honest
- ✅ Rewrote ARCHITECTURE.md to acknowledge over-engineering
- ✅ Updated conversation-control.md to be realistic

## Still Needs Work

### Future Docs (contain philosophical speculation)
- `/docs/future/dimensional-prompts-future.md` - Contains "vision" language
- `/docs/future/linguistic-metrics-design.md` - Assumes emergence is real
- `/docs/future/phased-prompts-future.md` - More speculative features

These should either be:
1. Deleted entirely
2. Moved to an "archive" folder with warnings
3. Rewritten to acknowledge they're speculative

### Archive Docs
- Should add warnings that these are historical/outdated

### Main Issues Addressed
1. Removed claims about "emergent communication"
2. Added skeptical note about pattern detection
3. Acknowledged metrics are arbitrary
4. Honest about what actually works vs what doesn't
5. Called out over-engineering
6. Removed excitement/vision language

### Key Message Now
- It's a conversation logger with a pause button
- The event system is over-engineered
- Convergence metrics are meaningless
- No scientific validation exists
- Most "patterns" are likely random or artifacts
