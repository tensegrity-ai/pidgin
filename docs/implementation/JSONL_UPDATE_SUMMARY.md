# JSONL-First Architecture Implementation Summary

## What We Built

We've successfully implemented a JSONL-first event architecture to solve DuckDB concurrency issues. The system now:

1. **Writes events to JSONL files only** during active conversations/experiments
2. **Batch loads to DuckDB automatically** after completion
3. **Provides full observability** without any database reads during execution

## Key Components Added

### 1. StateBuilder (`pidgin/experiments/state_builder.py`)
- Reconstructs experiment/conversation state from JSONL files
- Supports live tailing of events
- Zero database dependencies

### 2. New CLI Commands

#### `pidgin experiment attach <id>` 
- Attach to running experiments (like `screen -r`)
- Default mode: Progress bar with live stats
- `--tail` mode: Stream events as they happen
- Ctrl+C detaches without stopping

#### `pidgin monitor`
- System-wide health monitor
- Shows all active experiments
- Reads from JSONL files only
- Updates every 2 seconds

#### `pidgin load-db` (hidden)
- Manual batch loading tool
- `--all`: Load all completed experiments
- `--force`: Reload existing data
- Hidden command - usually not needed (auto-loading handles it)
- Still accessible for debugging/advanced use

### 3. Updated Commands
- `pidgin experiment list` - Now reads from JSONL
- `pidgin experiment status` - Now reads from JSONL

### 4. Automatic Batch Loading
- **Experiments**: Load to DuckDB when complete
- **Single chats**: Load to `~/.pidgin/chats.duckdb` when complete
- Creates `.loaded_to_db` marker files
- Failures don't break anything

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Zero Concurrency Issues**: Append-only JSONL = no locks
2. **Crash Resilient**: Rebuild state anytime from events
3. **Debuggable**: Use grep/jq/tail on JSONL files
4. **Fast**: File I/O with OS caching
5. **Simple**: No daemons, queues, or coordination

## Testing

The system has been rebuilt and installed with `./pidgin_dev.sh rebuild`.

Try these commands:
```bash
# Start an experiment
pidgin experiment start -a claude -b gpt -r 5 --name test

# Monitor it live
pidgin experiment attach test

# Check system health
pidgin monitor

# List all experiments (no DB access!)
pidgin experiment list
```

## What Changed

1. Disabled real-time DB writes in `event_bus.py`
2. Added automatic batch loading in `ExperimentRunner` 
3. Added automatic batch loading in `Conductor` for single chats
4. Created new monitoring infrastructure based on JSONL
5. All observability commands now read from JSONL files

The system is now fully functional with zero database concurrency issues!
