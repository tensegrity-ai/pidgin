# Current Status

*Last updated: December 2024*

## Summary

Pidgin works for single conversations. We've observed interesting patterns. Nothing is validated. Batch experiments are needed.

## Component Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Working
- Event-driven architecture
- 15+ model support across 4 providers
- Streaming responses
- Ctrl+C interrupt
- Output to `./pidgin_output/`
- Poetry package management

### üöß Partially Implemented
- **Convergence calculation** - Works but not displayed
- **Context tracking** - Logic exists, not integrated
- **Configuration** - Works but convergence threshold not configurable

### ‚ùå Not Implemented
- **Batch experiments** - Critical for research
- **Convergence stopping** - Needs threshold trigger
- **Statistical analysis** - No validation tools
- **Message injection** - Can pause but not inject

## Quick Fixes Needed

1. **Display convergence** in UI (~20 lines)
2. **Add threshold stopping** (~50 lines)
3. **Make threshold configurable** (~10 lines)

## Major Work Needed

1. **Batch runner** - New module for parallel execution
2. **Analysis pipeline** - Tools to validate patterns
3. **Result aggregation** - Database or structured storage

## Known Issues

- Token counting is word-based estimates
- Some type mismatches in context manager
- No retry logic for network errors
- Can't resume from event logs (yet)

## File Organization

Planning to reorganize ~20 files into:
- `core/` - Event bus, conductor, types
- `providers/` - AI integrations (already clean)
- `analysis/` - Convergence, metrics, context
- `ui/` - Display, interaction, components
- `config/` - Configuration, prompts, models
- `io/` - Output, transcripts, logging

## Research Status

- Observed patterns in ~100 conversations
- No statistical validation
- Need N=100+ per condition
- Batch execution is blocking everything

## How to Help

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for setup. Priority:
1. Implement batch runner
2. Add convergence display/stopping
3. Build analysis tools
4. Run experiments
