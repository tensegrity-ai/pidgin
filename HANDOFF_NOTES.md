# Handoff Notes - Database Consolidation Complete

## What Was Just Completed

Successfully consolidated the entire database layer from async (AsyncDuckDB + repositories) to a single synchronous EventStore class. This was triggered by fixing a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'NoneType'` error in TranscriptGenerator.

## Key Changes Made

1. **EventStore Consolidation**
   - Renamed `SyncEventStore` → `EventStore` 
   - Deleted `AsyncDuckDB` and all repository classes
   - All database operations are now synchronous (no more `await`)
   - Located at: `pidgin/database/event_store.py`

2. **Schema Changes**
   - Removed foreign key constraints due to DuckDB UPDATE limitation
   - DuckDB rewrites UPDATE as DELETE+INSERT, causing FK violations
   - See: https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/10574

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Created comprehensive tests: `tests/database/test_event_store.py`
   - Fixed TranscriptGenerator NoneType handling with tests
   - All 38 database tests passing

## Current TODO Status

### Completed
- ✅ Create sync EventStore class
- ✅ Fix foreign key constraints and duplicate key issues
- ✅ Remove import CLI command (imports happen automatically)
- ✅ Update all repository methods to be synchronous
- ✅ Remove foreign key constraints from schema
- ✅ Rename SyncEventStore to EventStore
- ✅ Update all callers to use sync EventStore
- ✅ Delete AsyncDuckDB
- ✅ Create comprehensive EventStore tests
- ✅ Fix TranscriptGenerator NoneType errors

### Still Pending (High Priority)
- Create tests for name_coordinator.py
- Create tests for context_manager.py  
- Create tests for event_wrapper.py
- Create tests for token_handler.py
- Refactor MetricsCalculator (437 lines) into smaller modules

## Important Notes

1. **No Foreign Keys**: Due to DuckDB limitations, we removed FK constraints. Data integrity must be maintained in application code.

2. **EventStore is Synchronous**: All database calls are now synchronous. Don't use `await` with EventStore methods.

3. **JSONL Import**: EventStore has built-in JSONL import functionality via `import_experiment_from_jsonl()`

4. **Temperature Storage Fixed**: Fixed issue where agent temperatures weren't being stored in conversations table

## Next Steps Recommendation

Focus on the remaining test coverage for:
- `pidgin/core/name_coordinator.py`
- `pidgin/providers/context_manager.py`
- `pidgin/providers/event_wrapper.py`
- `pidgin/database/token_handler.py`

These are core components that need test coverage to prevent regressions.

Good luck!
