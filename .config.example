# Minimal Pidgin Configuration for ~/.config/pidgin.yaml
# This configuration allows very long conversations

# Let conversations run until context is nearly full

  auto_pause_threshold: 95 # Pause at 95% full

# De-emphasize rate limits (tokens per minute)

  rate_warning_threshold: 95  # Only warn at extreme usage
  rate_pause_threshold: 98    # Almost never pause for rate limits
  show_rate_usage: false      # Hide rate metrics

# Log attractors but don't stop
