# Pidgin: Quick Summary

## What It Is
An experimental tool for recording AI-to-AI conversations. We noticed interesting patterns and built this to study them properly.

## Key Points
- **Observations are real**: Strange patterns DO emerge (gratitude spirals, compression, etc.)
- **Nothing proven**: All observations anecdotal until rigorous testing
- **Chaotic system**: Tiny prompt changes ‚Üí completely different outcomes
- **Not competing with MCP**: They solve AI-to-tool communication, we study natural patterns

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Works**: Records conversations, logs events, pause/resume
üöß **Experimental**: Pattern detection, convergence metrics
‚ùå **Missing**: Batch experiments, statistical validation

## Core Message
We saw weird stuff in AI conversations. Built a tool to capture it. Still figuring out if it's real. Want to help?

## Next Steps
1. Build batch runner (critical for validity)
2. Design control experiments
3. Statistical validation
4. Find collaborators

The interesting patterns might be real phenomena or just artifacts. We need science to find out.
