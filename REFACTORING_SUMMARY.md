# MetricsCalculator Refactoring Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully refactored the MetricsCalculator module from a single 436-line file into a modular architecture:

### Before:
- `calculator.py`: 436 lines (monolithic)

### After:
- `calculator.py`: 221 lines (orchestrator)
- `text_analysis.py`: 100 lines (text parsing and analysis)
- `convergence_metrics.py`: 103 lines (convergence and similarity calculations)
- `linguistic_metrics.py`: 96 lines (linguistic and stylistic analysis)

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Each module has a clear, single responsibility
2. **Easier Testing**: Can test individual components in isolation
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
4. **Reusability**: Individual analyzers can be used independently

## API Changes

The output structure changed from flat to nested:

### Old Structure:
```python
{
    'message_length_a': 25,
    'word_count_a': 5,
    'vocabulary_overlap': 0.5,
    ...
}
```

### New Structure:
```python
{
    'agent_a': {
        'message_length': 25,
        'word_count': 5,
        ...
    },
    'agent_b': {
        'message_length': 30,
        'word_count': 6,
        ...
    },
    'convergence': {
        'vocabulary_overlap': 0.5,
        'cross_repetition': 0.2,
        ...
    }
}
```

## Tests Updated

All 20 MetricsCalculator tests were updated to work with the new structure and are passing.

## Next Steps

The refactored architecture makes it easier to:
- Add new metrics to specific categories
- Optimize individual calculations
- Add specialized analyzers (e.g., sentiment analysis)
- Test components in isolation
