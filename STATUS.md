# Project Status

A brutally honest assessment of what works, what doesn't, and what's missing.

## ‚úÖ What Actually Works

- **Basic conversation runner**: You can run a conversation between two AI models
- **Event logging**: Everything gets logged to events.jsonl (whether you need it or not)
- **Streaming output**: See responses as they're generated
- **Pause/resume**: You can Ctrl+C to pause, then continue or exit
- **Output files**: Creates conversation.md (readable) and conversation.json (structured)

That's it. It's a conversation runner with logging.

## üöß What Exists But Doesn't Really Work

- **Convergence metrics**: 
  - Calculates some numbers based on token overlap
  - No scientific basis
  - Not displayed anywhere
  - Probably meaningless

- **Context tracking**:
  - Code exists to track token usage
  - Doesn't integrate with anything
  - No actual context window management

- **Event system**:
  - Over-engineered for what we need
  - Works fine but adds complexity
  - Could have been simple function calls

## ‚ùå What's Completely Missing

- **Batch experiments**: Can only run one conversation at a time
- **Statistical analysis**: No way to analyze patterns across conversations
- **Control conditions**: No shuffled/baseline comparisons
- **Intervention system**: Can't modify conversations mid-stream
- **Checkpoint/resume**: Can't resume from a specific point
- **Multi-agent**: Only supports 2 agents despite architecture that could handle more
- **Validation pipeline**: No infrastructure for testing hypotheses

## üìä Reality Check

### What we claimed vs. what exists:
- **"Studies emergent communication"** ‚Üí Records conversations
- **"Convergence detection"** ‚Üí Calculates arbitrary metrics
- **"Event-driven architecture"** ‚Üí Unnecessary complexity
- **"Pause/resume conversations"** ‚Üí It's just a pause button
- **"Intervention system"** ‚Üí Doesn't exist

### Technical debt:
- Event system is overkill for serial message passing
- Convergence calculations have no theoretical basis
- Architecture assumes n-agents but hard-coded for 2
- Many half-implemented features

## üî¨ What Would Make This Scientific?

To do actual research, we'd need:

1. **Batch runner**: Run 1000s of conversations with systematic variations
2. **Control conditions**: Shuffled responses, human-written responses
3. **Statistical analysis**: Pattern frequency, significance testing
4. **Hypothesis testing**: Pre-registered experiments with clear predictions
5. **Reproducibility**: Version locking, seed management, exact replay

## üéØ Realistic Next Steps

1. **Admit what it is**: A conversation logger with nice output formatting
2. **Remove half-baked features**: Strip out convergence metrics, unused event complexity
3. **Build batch infrastructure**: This is the main missing piece
4. **Design real experiments**: What patterns can we actually test?
5. **Get statistical help**: We need proper experimental design

## üí≠ Should This Project Continue?

Honest questions:
- Is there anything here beyond confirmation bias?
- Are we just seeing training data artifacts?
- Would batch experiments find anything meaningful?
- Is this solving a problem that exists?

The answer might be no. But we won't know without proper experiments.

## ü§ù How to Help

If you're interested despite all these limitations:

1. **Run conversations**: Document what you see (including boring results)
2. **Build batch runner**: This is the critical missing piece
3. **Design experiments**: Propose testable hypotheses
4. **Statistical analysis**: Help design proper validation
5. **Be skeptical**: Challenge our observations

The most helpful thing would be someone saying "I ran 1000 conversations and found nothing interesting."
