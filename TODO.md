# Pidgin Project TODO

Last Updated: July 6, 2025

## Overview

This document tracks the ongoing refactoring and enhancement work for Pidgin. The goal is to create a clean, maintainable research tool for studying AI-to-AI conversation dynamics.

**MAJOR UPDATE**: Comprehensive code audit completed on July 6, 2025. See CODE_AUDIT_REPORT.md for full details.

## Priority 0: Critical Security Fixes (Immediate)

### [DONE] Command Injection Vulnerabilities (FIXED)
- **Location**: `pidgin/cli/notify.py` (lines 21-22, 36-37), `pidgin/cli/ollama_setup.py` (line 85-89)
- **Risk**: Arbitrary command execution through unsanitized inputs
- **Fix**: Use `shlex.quote()` or array-based subprocess calls
- **Impact**: HIGH - Could allow malicious code execution

### [DONE] Other Security Issues (FIXED)
- [DONE] Path traversal risks in output paths - Added validation
- [DONE] Missing input validation limits (turns, repetitions) - Added IntRange limits
- [DONE] Integer overflow possibilities - Bounded with reasonable limits

- [DONE] Removed screen-like attach/detach behavior
- [DONE] Added process titles for daemons (pidgin-exp12345)

## Not Doing

These items have been explicitly decided against:
- **Real-time dashboards** - Adds complexity without sufficient value
- **Live experiment monitoring** - Static status commands are sufficient  
- **Complex visualizations** - Let researchers use their own tools
- **Separate enrichment commands** - Will be handled transparently via GraphQL
- **Screen-like attach/detach** - Use standard Unix tools instead

## Architecture Notes

### Event System
- All events must be preserved during refactoring
- Analysis depends on complete event streams
- No hidden state outside of events

### Provider System  
- Providers remain agnostic (API vs local)
- Clean abstraction boundaries
- Add proper cleanup methods

### Sequential Execution
- Default max_parallel = 1 due to rate limits and hardware constraints
- Architecture supports parallelism but reality requires sequential
- Document this clearly to set expectations

## Development Philosophy

From CLAUDE.md:
- Build only what's needed
- Present data, not narratives
- Use skeptical language
- Keep modules under 200 lines
- Methods under 50 lines

## Priority 8: Low Priority Issues

### Repository Cleanup
- [ ] **Remove orphaned files**
  - Delete nested pidgin_output/experiments/pidgin_output/
  - Remove banner_options.txt
  - Clean up debug_output.txt
  - Add .DS_Store to .gitignore

### Minor Code Issues
- [ ] **Address 5 TODO comments**
  - token_handler.py:89-91 (config from provider)
  - conversation_lifecycle.py:346 (gather metrics)
  - event_handler.py:384 (gratitude spiral detection)
  - event_wrapper.py:94 (track retry count)

- [ ] **Remove unused ConversationError exception**
- [ ] **Document Router Protocol purpose or remove**

2. **Add asyncio locks to EventBus** - Fix critical thread safety (1 hour)
3. **Extract provider error constants** - Reduce duplication (2 hours)
