# Pidgin Project TODO

Last Updated: July 9, 2025

## Overview

This document tracks the ongoing refactoring and enhancement work for Pidgin. The goal is to create a clean, maintainable research tool for studying AI-to-AI conversation dynamics.

**MAJOR UPDATE**: Comprehensive code audit completed on July 6, 2025. See CODE_AUDIT_REPORT.md for full details.
**UPDATE July 7, 2025**: Completed EventStore repository refactoring and all Priority 1-2 code quality issues.
**UPDATE July 9, 2025**: Completed constants module, API key management, Google error handling, and display system improvements.

## Priority 0: Critical Security Fixes (Immediate)

## Not Doing

These items have been explicitly decided against:
- **Real-time dashboards** - Adds complexity without sufficient value
- **Live experiment monitoring** - Static status commands are sufficient  
- **Complex visualizations** - Let researchers use their own tools
- **Separate enrichment commands** - Will be handled transparently via GraphQL
- **Screen-like attach/detach** - Use standard Unix tools instead

## Architecture Notes

### Event System
- All events must be preserved during refactoring
- Analysis depends on complete event streams
- No hidden state outside of events

### Provider System  
- Providers remain agnostic (API vs local)
- Clean abstraction boundaries
- Add proper cleanup methods

### Sequential Execution
- Default max_parallel = 1 due to rate limits and hardware constraints
- Architecture supports parallelism but reality requires sequential
- Document this clearly to set expectations

## Development Philosophy

From CLAUDE.md:
- Build only what's needed
- Present data, not narratives
- Use skeptical language
- Keep modules under 200 lines
- Methods under 50 lines
